👋 Hi, I'm Yurii

I'm a Senior Full-Stack Engineer with extensive experience in web and software development. 
Over 8 years, I've worked on a variety of remote jobs, specializing in React, Node.js, TypeScript, and scalable system architecture.

🔹 I recently created this GitHub account for freelancing, as my previous work was primarily on GitLab, Bitbucket, and Jira. 
    Due to NDA restrictions, I can't share past repositories, but I've migrated select projects that are not affected by NDAs.

🚀 I'm excited to collaborate with new teams and contribute to impactful projects.
🙏 Big thanks to those who continue to support and follow me—I truly appreciate it!

Let's build something amazing together! 💻✨
